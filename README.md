# 🏥 Patient Wait List Analysis – Power BI Project

This project presents a healthcare data analysis of patient wait lists using **Power BI**, covering the period from **January 2018 to March 2021**. The goal is to track key performance metrics, understand delays in patient care, and support better resource planning through data visualization.

## 📊 Project Objectives

- Analyze wait list data for **outpatient**, **inpatient**, and **day case** services
- Identify **long-wait cases** and specialties under pressure
- Track trends across **age groups** and **time bands**
- Use **KPIs (Key Performance Indicators)** to guide data-driven decisions
- Build a clear and interactive **Power BI dashboard** for healthcare insights

## 🔍 Key Insights & KPIs

- **Total Wait List**: 709,000 patients (↑ 10.8% from 640K previous year)
- **By Case Type**:
  - Outpatients: 628K+
  - Day Cases: 57K+
  - Inpatients: 22K+
- **Average Median Wait Times**:
  - Outpatients: ~80 days
  - Inpatients: ~18 days
  - Day Cases: ~12 days
- **Critical Delays**:
  - Thousands of patients waiting **18+ months**
  - Especially in paediatric dermatology (167 days) and ENT (147 days)
- **Age Group Most Affected**:
  - Adults (16–64), followed by Seniors (65+) and Children (0–15)
- **Trends**:
  - Steady growth in patient wait lists over time
  - Notable spikes during the COVID-19 period

## 📊 What is "Wait Time"?

Wait time refers to how long a patient waits between being added to a treatment list and actually receiving care. It’s a key factor in patient outcomes, satisfaction, and overall system efficiency.

## 🧠 About the Data

- **Outpatient & Inpatient Files**: Monthly Excel sheets grouped by wait time bands and age profiles
- **Reference Data**: `mapping_specialty.xlsx` links each specialty to categories or departments for analysis
- **Time Bands**: Group patients by how long they’ve been waiting (e.g., 0–3 months, 18+ months)

## ⚙️ Tools Used

- **Power BI** – for data modeling, visualization, and dashboard creation
- **Excel** – for raw data handling and cleaning

## ✅ Purpose

This project is designed to:
- Help healthcare professionals and analysts identify long wait times
- Improve scheduling and resource allocation
- Highlight the importance of using real-time **KPI tracking** in managing healthcare delivery

## 🧾 Conclusion

Delays in patient treatment can lead to serious health consequences. By analyzing historical wait list data through clear KPIs and interactive dashboards, healthcare teams can gain valuable insights into where service delivery is falling behind. This project highlights the power of data in identifying bottlenecks, prioritizing action, and ultimately improving patient care.
